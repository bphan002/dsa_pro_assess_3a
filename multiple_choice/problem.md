## 1. When would you typically use a heap data structure?
- a. When you need to maintain a sorted collection and frequently insert new elements.
- b. When you need to efficiently find the median of a set of numbers.
- c. When you need to implement a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue.
- d. When you need to implement a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack.

## 2. In a simple undirected graph with V vertices, how many edges can there be at most?
- a. V
- b. (V*(V-1))/2
- c. V^2
- d. V + 1

## 3. When traversing a matrix graph, what do you typically need to ALWAYS check for before traversing to adjacent cells? (Select all that apply)
- a. Whether the adjacent cell has a higher value than the current cell.
- b. Whether the adjacent cell is within the bounds of the matrix.
- c. Whether the adjacent cell contains a wall or obstacle.
- d. Whether the adjacent cell is already visited.

## 4. What is the purpose of an adjacency list in graph theory?
- a. To store the coordinates of vertices in a graph.
- b. To represent the relationships between vertices by listing adjacent vertices for each vertex.
- c. To store the weights of edges in a graph.
- d. To maintain the order of vertices in a graph traversal algorithm.

## 5. 
- a. Directed graphs can have cycles.
- b. Every edge in a directed graph has an associated direction.
- c. Directed graphs always have the same number of edges as vertices.
- d. Directed graphs are commonly used to model social networks and web page links.
